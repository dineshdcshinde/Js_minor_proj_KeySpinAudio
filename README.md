# KeySpinAudio

KeySpinAudio is an interactive project where specific keypresses trigger a "jump and spin" animation with synchronized audio playback. When a key is released, the animation and audio stop. This project combines CSS animations and JavaScript for a responsive, engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Key-Activated Animations**: CSS animations respond directly to specific key presses.
- **Audio Feedback**: Each animation is paired with unique audio feedback on key press and stops on key release.
- **Seamless CSS and JavaScript Integration**: CSS keyframes and JavaScript event handling create smooth, responsive interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Keyframe Animations)
- **JavaScript** (Event Handling)
